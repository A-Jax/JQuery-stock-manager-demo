# JQuery-stock-manager-demo


A simple demonstration of what Javascript can do in a front end application. This will only exist whilst the session does, and would require a back end developer to set up properly. This is typically what you would be doing and then handing to the back end developer.

Demonstrating conditionals, variables, local and global. Classes and arrays, loops and console.
